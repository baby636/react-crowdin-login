|           | Default                                               | Short                                                                       |

| **Light** | ![light border lowerc](images/light_border_lowerc.svg) | ![light border lowerc short](images/light_border_lowerc_short.svg) |

You can [download buttons package](https://raw.github.com/crowdin/react-crowdin-login/master/images/buttons.zip) with buttons in PNG and SVG formats.

### Crowdin Login and other third-party login options

The **Crowdin Login** button must be displayed as prominently as other third-party login options. Buttons should have approximately the same size and similar visual weight.

### Matching your own app's style
It’s recommended to use the standard **Crowdin Login** button as it allows Crowdin users to identify the Crowdin option quickly. In case you need to adapt the button to match your app design or translate the text *Log in with* or *Log in*, follow the below guidelines.

#### Size
You can scale the button for different devices and screen sizes preserving the aspect ratio so that the Crowdin logo is not stretched.

#### Text
We recommend using the call-to-action text like *Log in with Crowdin* or *Sign up with Crowdin* to encourage users to click the button. It also should be clear to the users that they are logging in to or signing up for your app with their Crowdin credentials, and not signing up for Crowdin account using your app.

#### Crowdin Text
You can use the word *Crowdin* by itself in the button if it has the adjacent text that specifies what the action does.

#### Color
The color for an unpressed light button is `#FFFFFF` (white). The color for an unpressed dark (gray) button is `#2E3340`. The button background can be either gray or white, but the button must always include the contrast Crowdin logo.

#### Font
The button font is [Noto Sans KR](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+KR) and it’s recommended to be used for all texts on the button.

#### Padding
The padding to the left (and right) of the text should be 8dp. The logo should be 18dp, and there should be 24dp between the logo and the button text.

#### Crowdin logo on the login button
Regardless of the text, you can't change the size or color of the Crowdin logo. It must be the standard color version and contrast to the background with `#FFFFFF` or `#2E3340` colors.
